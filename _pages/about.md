Welcome! I'm Haoyu (Jacob) He, a recent graduate with a Master of Art in Statistics from [Columbia University](https://stat.columbia.edu/). I have just completed a one-year internship at the [World Wildlife Fund (WWF)](https://www.worldwildlife.org/), where I focused on Large Language Models (LLMs) and data lake development under the supervision of [Dave Thau](https://www.worldwildlife.org/experts/dave-thau). **Currently seeking a CS/AI PhD position for Fall 2025.**
Education
======
- **M.A. in Statistics**, [Columbia University](https://stat.columbia.edu/) (Sep 2022 - Dec 2023)
- **B.S. in Mathematics**, [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) (Aug 2020 - Apr 2022)
- **Mathematics**, [The Ohio State University](https://math.osu.edu/) (Aug 2018 - Apr 2020)

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on advancing the fields of [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), [information retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval), and [trustworthy AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustworthy_AI). 
Key areas of interest include:

1. Developing reliable and intelligent LLM agents
2. Exploring efficient alternatives to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
3. Leveraging advanced information retrieval techniques to enhance LLM performance
4. Unraveling the inner workings of LLMs to contribute to trustworthy AI systems

My work aims to deepen our understanding of these models and create more transparent, explainable, and dependable AI technologies for safe real-world deployment.
