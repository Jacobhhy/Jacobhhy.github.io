Welcome! I'm Haoyu (Jacob) He, currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Georgia](https://www.cs.uga.edu/) under the supervision of [Zhen Xiang](https://www.cs.uga.edu/directory/people/zhen-xiang). Prior to starting my PhD, I completed a one-year internship at the [World Wildlife Fund (WWF)](https://www.worldwildlife.org/), where I focused on Large Language Models and data lake development under the supervision of [Dave Thau](https://www.worldwildlife.org/experts/dave-thau).

I'm open to collaborations and always interested in connecting with fellow researchers. Feel free to reach out!
