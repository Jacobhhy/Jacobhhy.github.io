Academic Projects
======
**[Reproduction of "A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations"](https://github.com/d29f/E4040-SimCLR)** Dec 2023
- Supervisor: Dr. Mehmet Kerem Turkcan
- Implemented a SimCLR model using TensorFlow 2 and Keras for contrastive learning on CIFAR-100.
- Developed custom data augmentation techniques and NT-Xent loss function for self-supervised learning.
- Utilized transfer learning with ResNet architecture, trained on Google Cloud Platform in a team of three.

**[Predicting Apple Inc.'s Stock Closing Price with LSTM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LqMk84YSoiuwxS0AuimtXHc0lNKefQJGPnKnEJnJOlo/edit?usp=sharing)** Apr 2023
- Supervisor: Dr. Gabriel Young
- Developed an LSTM model using PyTorch to forecast Apple's stock prices based on 5 years of historical data.
- Implemented data preprocessing, including MinMaxScaler normalization and time series decomposition.
- Achieved accurate predictions (RMSE: 7.48) using rolling forecast validation on an 80-20 train-test split.

**Weakly Supervised Learning: Label Noise and Correction** May 2023
- Supervisor: Ying Liu
- Developed an image classification model for CIFAR-10 dataset with noisy labels using PyTorch.
- Implemented a label correction approach to address label noise, improving model accuracy.
- Achieved improved performance over baseline, balancing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.
